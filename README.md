# Style-Transfer-Deep-CNN
Apply Style transfer on my profile picture. 

#1 Load VGG19 features. 

#2 Load in Content and Style Images

#3 Use a pre-trained VGG19 Net to extract content or style features from a passed in image 
(19-layer VGG Network, which is comprised of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, and a few fully-connected layers).

#4 Formalize the idea of content and style losses and use those to iteratively update our target image until we get a result that we want.
